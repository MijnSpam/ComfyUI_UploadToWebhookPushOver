![ComfyUI Node](images/image-connect.png)

A custom node for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that allows you to _send generated image(s)_  directly to Pushover, you can also choose only to get a notifycation. Videos aren't supported.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔗 Upload a single image (from image sequence) with your pushover notification (optional)
- 📦 Includes additional message text (prompt for example)

---

## 🔧 Installation (for updating from v1.0.x to v1.2.x read the update.md file.)

1. Clone or download this repo into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory:

## 🧩 How to Use

In Pushover.net create an application token and paste this into your Token field.
Optional, edit default value in __init__.py 
Optional: Create a delivery group if you want to be flexible in notifying devices. _(then you only need to edit in pushover instead of changing userkeys)_
In User field, enter specific device key **or** add group key.

In ComfyUI:

1. Drag any output (e.g., from `VAE Decode`) to the **Send To Pushover** node >> connect_anything

2. Configure:
    - `connect_anything` : connect any output (mandatory to work)
    - `webhook_url`: default is correct.
    - `token`: the pushover app token (or use stored credentials option, see step 3)
    - `user`: Your user OR group key.
    - `image`: if you want an image in your pushover, connect this node and switch on attach_image
3. Optional (since version 1.2)
   create an .env in the same folder as this custom-node, see example folder but rename to '.env'
   in the node select, 'use stored credentials', any credentials in the node fields will be ignored **even when you enter them!**
